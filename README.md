# Lumeni: Front End Capstone

Lumeni is data management system inspired by my work with a nonprofit organization, the Appalachian Prison Book Project (APBP). APBP sends books to people who are incarcerated across a six-state region, and there are several similar projects across the country. Lumeni keeps track of 1) books sent to facilities 2) returns sent back to the project from the facilities and not delivered to their recipient and 3) details of the facilities themselves (including numbers of books sent and returns recieved). It streamlines recordkeeping and eliminates the need for spreadsheets, which can become cumbersome. In addition, it generates graphs displaying statistics that are helpful for year-end reporting, grant applications, etc.

## Tech Stack

Lumeni was created using the React.js framework with a mock JSON API serving as the database. It incorporates React-Bootstrap and React-ChartsJS.
